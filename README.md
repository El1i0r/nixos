A NixOS flake which is pretty messy as of now
It is ABSOLUTELY NOT INTENDED to be used on other devices than mine, I am not a professional, if you still want to use the config, just look over and see what changes you should make, otherwise it can render your MACHINE UNBOOTABLE.

Hosts
====
* `ORBIUM-A5`: A Thinkpad-E14 First Gen, my daily driver and only host as *OF NOW*. Uses my AwesomeWM config

# What I used for the AwesomeWM rice:

Configurations will be found in ~/.config directory. There is no seperate repo...
Have ~~not~~ fun!
